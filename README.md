# uca-randomizer

Random name generator for UCA students. Used to fairly assign tasks and give prizes. Also used as programming club example code.

To run from command line just use "python randomstudent.py"
Optionally, can pass in extra integer parameter from terminal, e.g. "python randomstudent.py 5" to return n number of names
